This project consists of analyzing two daily financial time series of returns which are respectively **Amazon** and **Meta** (Facebook).  

The main objective is to understand the economic reasons behind their positioning in the current global market and, more interestingly, to discover whether there are any economic reasons or situations linking these two **GAFAM** giants.  

In the following analysis, we present predictions for the evolution of these financial series
between 01/06/2012 and 01/12/2021.
