This research project consisted in analyzing two daily financial time series of returns which are respectively **Amazon** and **Meta** (Facebook).  
The main objective is to understand the economic reasons for their positioning in the current global market and, more interestingly, to find out whether there are any economic reasons or situations linking these two **GAFAM** giants.  

In the following analysis, we present predictions for the evolution of these financial series
between 01/06/2012 and 01/12/2021.
